  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2025</p>

  <p>Symptom Tracker ("the App") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not collect, transmit, or sell any personal or health information</strong>.
    All entries you create (symptoms, severity, notes) are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Backups & Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may choose to <strong>export</strong> your entries as CSV or encrypted backups.</li>
    <li>These files are stored only where you save them (e.g., device storage, cloud drive, or email) and under your control.</li>
    <li>The App never automatically uploads your data to any external server.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Advertisements</h2>
  <p>
    The free version of the App may display third-party ads. Ad providers may use anonymized data
    (e.g., device type, general location) to show relevant ads. No personal health data is shared with advertisers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>
    The App offers a one-time purchase to remove ads. Payments are processed securely through
    <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. The App does not access your payment information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App may request limited permissions (e.g., file access for backup/restore). These are only used for the stated features and never for hidden data collection.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Control</h2>
  <p>
    You remain in full control of your data:
    <ul>
      <li>Delete entries at any time within the App.</li>
      <li>Clear backups and exports youâ€™ve created.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated as needed. Updates will be posted here with a revised effective date.
  </p>
